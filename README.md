# Summary

The Clinical Psychology curriculum is a **complete education in Clinical Psychology** using online materials.

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## Organization

- *Intro Clinical Psychology*: Orientation and fundamentals to test fit, build study habits, and introduce key concepts in psychology with a clinical lens.
- *Core Clinical Psychology*: Roughly the first three years of undergraduate study; required foundational topics including research tools, major subfields, and clinical basics.
- *Advanced Clinical Psychology*: Final-year electives; learners choose one specialization from 4 options (Counseling, Neuropsychology, Health Psychology, Forensic Psychology) to develop deeper expertise, completing all courses in that track.
- *Final Project*: A capstone project to consolidate and showcase knowledge, suitable for peer review or portfolio inclusion.

**Duration**. **1–2 years** at **~20 hours/week** (40–50 learning weeks/year). The roadmap below is sequenced for sustainability, but you can slow down or accelerate as needed.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.


# Curriculum

Prerequisites are indicated per course; overall sequencing: Start with Intro, then Core (Statistics and Research Methods can be taken early or in parallel with other Core courses), followed by Advanced (after completing relevant Core), and end with Capstone.

Prerequisite graph: Intro Psychology → (Biological Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, Personality Psychology, Abnormal Psychology) → Introduction to Clinical Psychology → Advanced Tracks → Final Project. 

Statistics and Research Methods are prerequisites for most Core and Advanced courses but can be studied concurrently with Intro.
