# Summary

The Psychology curriculum is a **complete education in Psychology** using online materials.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

Notes:
 
- For the **general overview**, the free [*Psychology 2e* textbook from OpenStax](https://openstax.org/details/books/psychology-2e) is an excellent backbone: it covers virtually all foundational topics — research methods, biology, cognition, social mind, disorders, etc.
- For **biology-oriented topics**, the free *Biological Psychology* (Hove & Martinez, 2024) is recent and well-structured for self-learners. [ROTEL](https://rotel.pressbooks.pub/biologicalpsychology/)
- Lecture-based MOOCs/OCW courses from top universities (e.g. MIT, Yale) give you real “classroom-style” pacing and feel — useful especially when you self-study. [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-00-introduction-to-psychology-fall-2004/)
